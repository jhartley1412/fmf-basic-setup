			<h2> Whow We Are </h2>

			<p>If you've ever lost a pet, then you've probably had to deal with printing out countless flyers and sticking them all over town, hoping some good samaritan will come along and help with the search. Doesn't always work. Sometimes you need a little more. Sometimes you need a community of fellow pet owners that can keep an eye out for you. Find my Furball is an app where you can post a lost dog or cat or other furball as soon as you notice they're missing. Other users all around your local area will be notified of the missing pet. Likewise, if you see on our site a lost furball, and know of it's whereabouts, you are able to contact it's owners. </p>
